Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) for IBM's LMIC 1.6 communication stack 
targeted to RPi and Dragino LoRA/GPS HAT.

The goal was to keep the LMIC 1.6 sourcecode untouched, and just provide a
Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) for Raspberry Pi and Dragino LoRa/GPS HAT.

## Installation

### WiringPi
To control the RPi's GPI ports, the WiringPi GPIO interface library has to
be installed. On some operating systems WiringPi is already installed per
default. For instructions on manual installation please refer to the 
following site: 
http://wiringpi.com/download-and-install/

### Enable SPI interface
Per default, the SPI ports on the Raspberry Pi are disabled. You need to
manually enable them using raspi-config.
Follow the instructions given here: 
https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/raspberrypi/spi/README.md

## Note on LMIC 1.6 license
Text copied from https://www.research.ibm.com/labs/zurich/ics/lrsc/lmic.html

IBM "LoRa WAN in C" is the LoRa WAN implementation of choice, and a perfect
match to the IBM LRSC on the end device. It is provided as open source under 
the BSD License.

## Example "hello"
Directory: /examples/hello

Modifications neccessary: None

This example does not use radio, it just periodically logs a counter value.
Can be used to checked if the timer implemenation on RPi works as expected.

    cd examples/hello
    make clean
    make
    sudo ./build/hello.out
